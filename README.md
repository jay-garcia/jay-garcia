## Hi there 👋 I'm Jesús

💻 Software Engineer | Aspiring Cloud & DevOps Engineer
☁️ Currently exploring Google Cloud & Kubernetes
📚 Learning through the Coursera Cloud DevOps Engineer Specialization

### I’m a Software Engineer with 6 years of development experience, currently diving deep into the world of DevOps and Cloud Engineering. My recent focus has been on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and modern DevOps practices such as containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD automation.

To sharpen my skills, I’m actively working through the [Coursera specialization “Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud DevOps Engineer”](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/sre-devops-engineer-google-cloud)!

I love learning by doing and am excited to continue growing at the intersection of software development and cloud operations.
