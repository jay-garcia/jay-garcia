## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JesÃºs

### I am a software engineer learning about DevOps as I've become really interested in it lately. I am currently working on completing the [Coursera Course: Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud DevOps Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/sre-devops-engineer-google-cloud)!

#### Fun fact: I am hoping to move out of Boston someday and explore a new city.
